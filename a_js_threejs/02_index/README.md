Hello world for Three.js, 
try plotting Neural Network AND Gate visualization in 3D space.

## What I'm learning / trying
1. Basic Three.js scene lifecycle (scene, camera, renderer).
2. Modular code structure using ES modules.
3. Coordinate helpers and plotting utilities.
4. Basic lighting and axis/plane helpers to visualize 3D space.
5. Serving ES module pages locally (simple static server).

## Files
1. `02_index.html` — HTML entry that loads the module.
2. `02_index.js` — Main module that starts the demo.
3. `scene_setup.js` — Scene, camera and renderer initialization helpers.
4. `axes.js` — Axis helpers / visual axes utilities.
5. `lights.js` — Lighting setup (directional, ambient, etc.).
6. `plotting_utils.js` — Small utilities to plot points/lines in the scene.
7. `xyz_plane.js` — XY / XZ / YZ plane helpers for reference.

## How to run (Windows)
just run .html through vscode live server
